## 💌 A little note

Bibble is a cozy learning-space concept designed to make studying feel less lonely and less overwhelming. Find a study room, settle into a focus session, and turn what you learn into a visual map of connected ideas—one little **bibble** at a time. 💗

The project is currently a **front-end prototype** for learning maps and study rooms. Email/password authentication and user/session persistence use the backend, while personal learning-map edits remain stored in your browser with `localStorage`. Study rooms, sample maps, and their illustrative content are not live or shared backend data. Numbers, hosts, and participant counts shown in sample content are illustrative UI data, not live users.

## 🌷 What you can explore

| Area | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Home** | Introduces Bibble and previews study rooms and a sample learning map. |
| **Study rooms** | Browses and searches sample rooms by room name, topic, and tags. Room pages provide a focused study-space experience. |
| **Explore maps** | Searches sample learning maps and filters them by category. |
| **Learning map viewer** | Displays ideas as nodes (called *bibbles*) connected by edges. Select a bibble to inspect its details. |
| **Create a map** | Starts a map with a title, description, and category, then opens the map editor. |
| **Map editor** | Adds, moves, connects, selects, and removes bibbles, and saves map changes locally. |
| **Bibble details** | Edits descriptions and notes, tracks status and progress, and provides a save action for changes. |
| **Theme controls** | Switches between Strawberry Red, Refreshing Green, and Strawberry Lemonade Beach themes, with light and dark modes. |
| **Local persistence** | Stores learning-map data and theme preferences in the current browser. Clearing browser storage can remove locally saved maps or preferences. |

### 🌱 The basic learning flow

1. Browse **Study rooms** to find a sample study space, or open **Explore maps** to find a roadmap.
2. Open a learning map and select a bibble to view its details.
3. Use **Create a map** to start your own learning map.
4. In the editor, add bibbles and connect related ideas.
5. Update each bibble's status, notes, description, and progress, then use the relevant save controls.
6. Return to the map in the same browser to continue where you left off.

### How the main pieces fit together

- **Routes in `app/`** compose each page and choose their page-level components.
- **Reusable UI in `components/`** separates the home, room, map, and bibble interfaces into maintainable pieces.
- **Static example content in `data/`** provides sample maps, room cards, categories, and themes.
- **Types in `types/`** describe learning maps, bibbles, their connections, rooms, and theme settings.
- **Hooks in `hooks/`** manage browser persistence and theme preferences.
- **Map helpers in `lib/`** create learning maps and translate between Bibble's map model and the XYFlow canvas representation.

## 🧩 Core concepts for contributors

### Learning map

A learning map contains a title, description, category, accent, a collection of bibbles, and connections between bibbles. A map's progress is calculated from the progress values of its bibbles.

### Bibble

A **bibble** is an individual learning idea or step in a map. It can include a title, description, status, progress percentage, position on the canvas, notes, and resources. The current statuses are:

- `not-started`
- `learning`
- `completed`

Progress is represented from 0 to 100. Marking a bibble completed sets its progress to 100 in the details UI.

### Connections

Edges connect one bibble to another to express relationships or learning order. The map editor uses XYFlow to render and interact with nodes and edges.

### Local data vs. a backend

Learning maps remain local to the browser under the `bibble-maps` local-storage key, and theme selection is also persisted locally. Local changes are tied to that browser/device and are not automatically synced to another browser or another user. Email/password authentication and user/session persistence are handled by the backend, but study rooms and sample maps are still illustrative content rather than live shared data.

The UI includes log-in and sign-up flows for authenticated accounts. Keep documentation precise about what works in the current code, especially the distinction between backend-backed accounts and locally stored learning maps.

---

## 🎨 Themes

Bibble currently defines three visual themes:

- 🍓 **Strawberry Red**
- 🍏 **Refreshing Green**
- 🌺 **Strawberry Lemonade Beach**

The theme picker also offers light and dark modes. Theme and mode preferences are stored in browser local storage, allowing the selection to persist for that browser.

When adding a theme, check its definition in `data/themes.ts`, the motif/type definitions, and theme handling in `hooks/use-theme.ts`. Keep the palette readable and accessible in both light and dark modes.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

Bibble supports email/password accounts through Supabase Auth. Supabase manages password hashing, email confirmation, and persistent cookie-based sessions. Learning maps and study progress remain stored in the browser until issue #37 adds hosted persistence.

For local development:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a Supabase project, then copy its URL and publishable key from **Project Settings → API** into `.env`:

```env
SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your-publishable-key"
```

In the Supabase Dashboard:

1. Enable the **Email** provider under **Authentication → Providers**.
2. Set the site URL to `http://localhost:3000` under **Authentication → URL Configuration**.
3. Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` to the allowed redirect URLs (and add the equivalent production callback URL before deploying).
4. Set the password policy to at least 12 characters with an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and special character so it matches the client and server validation.

New accounts receive a confirmation email when email confirmation is enabled. The callback exchanges the confirmation code for a secure Supabase session. Guest browsing, sample maps, previews, and browser-local map editing remain available without an account.

Never commit `.env`, database files, session secrets, or plaintext passwords. Sample maps and guest browsing remain available without an account. Learning maps remain stored locally in the browser; authenticated accounts do not persist user maps in the database.

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing

Contributions of all sizes are welcome: documentation fixes, usability improvements, accessibility, bug fixes, and focused features.

Before coding, read **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)**. It covers branch naming, pull-request conventions, and the project workflow.

A typical contribution workflow looks like this:

```bash

## 🧪 Testing checklist

Before submitting a change, consider checking:

- [ ] Home page renders and navigation links work.
- [ ] Study-room search filters the available sample rooms.
- [ ] Map search and category filters work together.
- [ ] A new map can be created with a title, description, and category.
- [ ] The editor can add a bibble, move/select nodes, connect bibbles, and save changes.
- [ ] Bibble status, notes, description, and progress behave as expected.
- [ ] Saved maps persist after refresh in the same browser.
- [ ] Theme selection and light/dark mode work.
- [ ] Layout remains usable on a narrow screen.
- [ ] `npm run lint` and `npm run build` complete, or any failures are documented.

## 🛣️ Current limitations and future opportunities

Bibble is a prototype, so some UI ideas are still illustrative rather than server-backed. Potential areas for future work include:

- Cloud syncing and sharing of learning maps.
- Real multi-user study rooms and presence.
- More robust resource editing and management.
- Expanded automated tests and accessibility checks.
- Improved mobile and small-screen map editing.

These are possible directions, not claims that the features already exist.
